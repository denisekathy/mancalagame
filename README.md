## Items:

#### 1 board with 2 rows of 6 holes and 2 mancalas/pits on opposite sides of the board and 48 marbles

## Rules:

### The game begins with 4 stones located in each circle of the 2 rows. The mancalas on each player's side should be empty. Player 1 will start the game by picking up marbles from a hole from their respective row and moving in a clockwise fashion to deposit one marble into each hole, skipping Player 2's mancala, until they run out of marbles. If Player 1's last marble was placed in their mancala then they get to take another turn. If not, it will revert to Player 2's turn.

## How to Win:

### The first player to reach 10 stones in their mancala will be determined the winner.
